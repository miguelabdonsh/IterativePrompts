## Analyze and refine prompts to generate marketing copy from a product

Prompt engineering is a strategy used in the field of artificial intelligence to guide language models in their response generation. It follows two basic principles:

- **Principle 1**: Write clear and specific instructions
- **Principle 2**: Give time to the model to "think"

This technology significantly improves the generation of responses, from summarizing a text focusing on the topics specified by the user to the generation of customer service emails that adapt to each customer's review. Below I show how to apply prompt engineering to a text to generate a marketing product.
